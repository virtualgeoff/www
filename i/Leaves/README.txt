"Leaves" demonstrates the performance benefits of using hardware accelerated CSS animations and transforms over pure JavaScript techniques to animate objects. It contains the "WithoutCSSExtensions" and "WithCSSExtensions" samples that both display colored leaves falling down. 
"WithoutCSS" uses a custom JavaScript object and the setTimeout function to animate the leaves. "WithCSSExtensions" uses the above CSS extensions to perform this animation.
