"Simple Browser" demonstrates how to create a 3-level drill-down application using HTML, CSS Transforms and Transitions extensions, and AJAX methods. The first level displays a list of Soccer European Championships for the last 10 years. When users click on a championship, the application navigates to a second level that shows the winner and all groups of that championship. When users click on a group, "Simple Browser" takes users to the third level, which shows all teams associated with that group.

This sample shows how to retrieve XML data remotely and cache data sources, 
populate and measure user interface elements, create and synchronize CSS Transitions on the fly, and handle touch events to provide the user instant feedback.
