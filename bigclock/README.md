# Big Clock

A clock, but BIG. The current time, in your current time zone, in ISO 8601.

The clock is big, but the pages are ultra-minimal: one request and less than 16 kB each. They are coded in plain vanilla JS (ES 5) and CSS (2.1), and designed specifically to work on older devices.

Feedback welcome. Iâ€™m especially interested in hearing about how it works on old browsers and phones.
