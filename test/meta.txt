resource-type 
This contains the template type to use in classifying this item. The only one currently 
supported is "document"; others don't really make sense in this context. This is the only 
tag which is required for indexing; the others are optional but generally a good idea. 

description 
Re-stating the title is not very helpful. 

keywords 
A set of keywords, delimited by commas, pertinent to the item. 

distribution 
The appropriate distribution for the item. The values are "global", "iu" (Internal Use) 
and "local" are the most common.
