		<p>This is the personal site of <a href="/contact.html">Geoff Pack</a>.</p>
		<p>I'm a web developer living in Sydney, Australia. I currently work for the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au">ABC</a>.</p>
		<p><a href="/portfolio/">Portfolio</a> is a list of sites I've worked on over the last 20+ years.</p>
		<p><a href="/demos/">Demos</a> is collection of small animations. Some are even mildly interesting.</p>
		<p><a href="/junkyard/">Javscript Junkyard</a> is a dump of old code, mostly from the 90s, that was useful long ago. Of historical interest only.</p>
		<p>BTW, I became "virtualgeoff" because my enthusiasm for <a href="/vrml/index.html">vrml</a> â€” I didn't choose it, but it stuck.</p>
