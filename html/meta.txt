The META Tag.

<HEAD>

<TITLE>Use a Globally Meaningful Title</TITLE>

<META name="resource-type" content="document">
<META name="description" content="Blurb goes here - don't just restate title.">
<META name="keywords" content="WWW, KWUIG, Search Engines, user groups">
<META name="author" content="Geoff Pack">
<META name="distribution" content="global">


<META HTTP-EQUIV="REFRESH" CONTENT="60; URL=http://...">

<!-- loads URL (reloads same page if no URL) after 60 seconds -->

<BASE HREF="http://host.domain/path/to/file/">

Controlling how your Web page is indexed by AltaVista

In the absence of any other information, AltaVista will index all words in your document (except for comments), and will use the first few words of the document as a short abstract. 

It is however possible for you to control how your page is indexed by using the META tag to specify both additional keywords to index, and a short description. Let's suppose your page contains: 

<META  name="description" content="We specialize in grooming pink poodles.">
<META  name="keywords" content="pet grooming, Palo Alto, dog">

AltaVista will then do two things: 

It will index both fields as words, so a search on either poodles or dog will match. 
It will return the description with the URL. In other words, instead of showing the first couple of lines of the page, a match will look like the following: 

Pink Poodles Inc 
       We specialize in grooming pink poodles.
       http://pink.poodle.org/ - size 3k - 29 Feb 96 

AltaVista will index the description and keywords up to a limit of 1,024 characters.

Spiders and META Tags

Various Spiders and Robots wander the 'Net looking for and indexing Web Pages. In order to assist them in identifing your pages and their content there are a number of HTML Tags that are important. Not ALL spiders and robots will use these tags,
but alot do and when they are present it makes the references to your pages much cleaner and nicer. 

The <TITLE></TITLE> is one that you cannot afford to miss. The contents of this tag should be very descriptive of your page and be able to describe the page out of context. "Home Page" and "Main Menu" are not very useful. 

Additionally, add some <META> tags to the top of the HTML document which provide higher-level information about it. Note that your document must have a name of ending with .html for the indexer to recognize it as such. The general form of
such tags is: 

<META name="name-goes-here" content="value-goes-here">

where name-goes-here and value-goes-here are replaced with other labels. Precisely which tags you want/need will depend how your site is configured, but here are typical ones: 

resource-type 

This contains the template type to use in classifying this item. The only one currently supported is "document"; others don't really make sense in this context. This is the only tag which is required for indexing; the others are optional but generally a good idea. 

description 

A short description, from a sentence to a paragraph, of what the item is about; an abstract. This will normally be shown along with the title, so simply re-stating the title is not very helpful. 

keywords 

A set of keywords, delimited by commas, pertinent to the item. 
distribution The appropriate distribution for the item. The values are "global", "iu" (Internal Use) and "local" are the most common. 

As an example of how this all works, here are the indexing tags for the Search Engine Presentation: 

<HEAD><TITLE>KWIUG - Dec 19, 1995 Search Engine Presentation</TITLE>
<META name="resource-type" content=document>
<META name="description" content="A presentation to the Kitchener
Waterloo Internet User Group on December 19th, 1995 demonstrating the
facilities and uses of search engines on the internet.">
<META name="keywords" content="WWW, KWUIG, Search Engines, user groups">
<META name=distribution content=global>
</HEAD>

Care should be taken in describing the web pages, because the more people index things in silly ways, the less effective the
whole thing is. 

Suggestions

DO NOT INDEX EVERY SINGLE HTML FILE YOU HAVE. Index a few which represent entry points
into a collection of related material. The global index is like the yellow pages; it's a list of available resources and services designed to allow the user to
find things easily. It's not a list of people, and it's certainly not a list of random cool links. Your indexing information will be displayed with no context, so it should be globally meaningful. 

The description should actually talk about the item, not restate the title.
