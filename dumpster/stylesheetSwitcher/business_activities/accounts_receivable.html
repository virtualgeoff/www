This substantially reduces the administration required to run a debtor's ledger financing facility.</p>	<p>The facility is simple, flexible and enables a client to draw against the available balance at any time.</p>	<p>FTA can, for an additional fee, provide value added services to your business, for example, monthly or weekly business performance measures against certain key performance indicators (such as stock turn ratios, GP and NP percentages and so on).</p>	<p>If you could benefit from an acceleration of your cashflow, but don't like the thought of factoring, then FTA's Accounts Receivable Financing facility may be just want you need. <a href="../about_us/contact.html">Contact us</a> for more information.</p>	<h2>Government Invoice Discounting</h2>	<p>FTA's unique InvoiceAdvance facility frees up cash flow by paying up to 95% of Government invoices direct into your bank account within 48 hours of approval.</p>	<p>The InvoiceAdvance facility operates with no financial information, personal guarantees or mortgages.</p>	<p>The facility is completely flexible, and allows you to choose which invoices to discount, and when. There is no complicated agreement that locks you into compulsory discounting arrangements.</p>	<p>Simple documentation, low cost, no hassles and no standby or hidden fees.</p>	<p>With FTA's InvoiceAdvance facility, you will never have to wait up to 60 days or sometimes more to be paid by Government.</p>	<p>If you do business with Government and would like a flexible, optional facility to accelerate your cashflow, <a href="../about_us/contact.html">contact us</a> today.</p></div><div id="footer">	<a href="about_us/contact.html">&copy;2004 Finance Technology Australia Pty Ltd</a> &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; 	<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer">xhtml</a> + 	<a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">css</a> 	</div></body></html>
