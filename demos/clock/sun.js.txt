Calculate sunrise and sunset times in Javascript.

This library extends the Javascript Date object, adding methods to calculate sunrise and sunset times. It also extends the Math object to add several useful support functions. If you don't like core JS types being extended you should probably rewrite this!

Based loosely and indirectly on Kevin Boone's SunTimes Java implementation of the US Naval Observatory's algorithm.
