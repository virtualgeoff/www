• check Tierion demo https://tierion.com/ and see if the script library has a homepage
	• otherwise copy the code and set up a stand alone demo

√︎ improve randomisation of velocity:
	√ random speed @ random angle
	√ then take sine and cosine

√ better random colors:
	√ use HSLA instead of RGBA ???

√ fix background gradient
	√ randomise

• add attractions and repulsion between dots
	• collisions (= v.short range repulsion)

• user interaction
	• attraction to / repulsion from cursor
	• add more or remove dots on the fly ?
	• sliders for setting properties

• do versions in SVG also



More generally:
---------------

• general particle emitter script
	• particle source and sinks?
	• finite lifespan
	• continuous addition and removal

etc...

• create versions in SVG and compare performance!
• do a 3D version with three.js? (or CSS3D ??)
