This folder contains my web site as it was about the time I left Scamedia i.e. September 1996. The test page is slightly changed, but all other pages are fundamentaly the same. I modifed the Test page before saving the old copy - there were some links to pages that handled cgi scripts, but the scripts were killed when I left Scam.I have no copy of my original pages at extro. They were not disimilar to this set, but had a dark grey-green textured background (smgreen.gif) and did not use frames. The pages consisted of a home page with photo, a resume (formated with <pre>, not tables), a link to the suwsa page, a page of aero links, a page of sex links, and the Newtown pages - (which are included here but not linked). Originally I had the photo of the woman with the vacuum cleaner on my home page before I scanned my own photos in.
