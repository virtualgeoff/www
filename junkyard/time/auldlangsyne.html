<h3>AULD LANG SYNE</h3>

<br>

<pre>
I:
   Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
      And never brought to min'?
   Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
      And days o' lang syne?

CHORUS:
         For auld syne, my dear,                           <i>old long ago</i>
            For auld lang syne,
         We'll tak a cup o' kindness yet,
            For auld lang syne.

II:
   We twa hae run about the braes,                            <i>hillsides</i>
      And pou'd the gowans fine;                         <i>pulled</i>/<i>daisies</i>
   But we've wander'd mony a weary foot,
      Sin auld lang syne.

III:
   We twa hae paidl't i' the burn,                         <i>waded</i>/<i>stream</i>
      Frae morning sun till dine,                      <i>noon</i>/<i>dinner-time</i>
   But seas between us braid hae roar'd                           <i>broad</i>
      Sin auld lang syne.

IV:
   And there's a hand, my trusty fiere,
      And gie's a hand o' thine,
   And we'll tak a right guid willie-waught,             <i>goodwill drink</i>
     For auld lang syne.

V:
   And surely ye'll be your pint-stowp,                         <i>pay for</i>
      And surely I'll be mine;
   And we'll tak a cup o' kindness yet
      For auld lang syne.

<h3>Robert Burns: AULD LANG SYNE</h3>

<p>A song of friendship and salutation recognised across the
English-speaking world, the Burns song we know and love to
sing on Burns's Night and at New Year was by no means the
first of its kind. Burns claimed to have transcribed it
'from an old man's singing', but a similar 'Auld Lang Syne'
tune was actually printed circa 1700 and is therefore certain to be
much older. The Burns version was adapted by Thomson (probably
with Burns's acquiescence) but Johnson had already reprinted
Allan Ramsay's 'Auld Lang Syne' (a different tune set to a love
song rather than a song of parting) in Vol I of SMM in 1787. The
timeless Burns gem still treasured to this day had to wait for
publication until after the
Bard's death and appeared in Vol V of SMM in 1796.</p>

<p>'Light be the turf on the breast of the heaven-inspired Poet
who composed this glorious Fragment' wrote Burns to Mrs Dunlop
on 7th December 1788. In a note to George Thomson (1793) he
describes it as 'the old song of the olden times, and which has never
been in print, nor even in manuscript, until I took it down
from an old man's singing.'</p>
